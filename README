Using axios to populate a select element and then based on the choice from the dropdown changes what the page shows.

What I learned

#######
I learned that using multiple functions isn't a bad thing. This helped me produce the move_speed by using it from the id
tag. I also learned how to use useState and useEffect to great success. They are the main components that allow this to
work.

How I would improve this

######
First of all I would try and implement a way to add more than just move_speed. I want to be able to display more information
to the page depending on what hero is selected. I might try and use react-router to try and just route up the pages that way.
Also using a dropdown was probably not the most efficient since I have so many choices. I will more than likely rewrite this
using a form and just typing in the hero's name that I want to find.
