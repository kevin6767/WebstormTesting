1) install react-router and make a new route, /hero-detail/{ID}, that will fetch details on each hero as you click on
them and render those in a new hero-detail component.
2) install redux and react-redux and start using actions and reducers for state management.
3) Add a realtime search, with auto-complete suggestions for heroes that lives at the top of the app, regardless of what
route a user is currently on.  When they choose a hero while searching, then it uses react-router's push(path) method to
just take them to that hero's detail page.
4) Install Bootstrap 4 and start styling the outputs to clean up the look and feel.

Extra Credit:

Make another route /heros-comparison/?id1={id}&id2={id} and create a page that will fetch the data and
show details of two heros on the view, while modifying the styling of the page to highlight differences
(i.e. green for something higher, or better, red for worse, etc).  Bonus points for NOT duplicating code
here and making REUSABLE components)
